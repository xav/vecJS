# vecJS
> fast and chainable matrix and vector math

## Installing
Just [download the package from GitHub](https://github.com/xav/vecJS/archives/master), unpack it and link to one of the vec.js files from your pages.

You can use `vec.dbg.js` while writing your code; it has some basics parameter checks to ensure that you don't forget to pass arrays and that they have the right size.
Once you're done though, you should switch to `vec.min.js`.
It's faster, and the purpose of the debug version is mainly to find syntax errors; you don't really need to waste time testing that when you now your code runs...

## Usage
